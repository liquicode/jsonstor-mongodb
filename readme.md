### A jsonstor adapter which stores documents on a MongoDB server.


Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------

`jsonstor` defines a single interface for database interaction and implements
	adapters for specific database products and libraries.
This interface is inspired by the MongoDB-style interface found in many other projects.
All database interaction is done through this interface and is the same across all database adapters.

This project is a plugin for the `jsonstor` project.
See: [`@liquiode/jsonstor`](https://github.com/liquicode/jsonstor).
